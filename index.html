            <h3>Changing Face of My Habitat</h3>
            <p>
               This page had been created at October 1, 2013 as an assignment which topic was Time Capsule. After site had been created any sigle line of code or content did not change. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The purpose of this time capsule is to collect things from the date when it had been created and kept it in a secure way to open it 10 years later. I selected the image that you are viewing as a background of this site.
            </p>
            <p>
               The background image had been taken from Google Maps which was a very popular web mapping service application and technology provided by Google. It is a satellite image that shows Middle East Technical University and 100. yil at Ankara, TURKEY. I.Melih Gokcek, mayor of Ankara, was building a highway between the border of university, 100. yil and Cigdem district. When this image had been taken, highway constraction had already begun but it was not finished and in this image you can not see the highway. In other words route of highway and affects of it did not observable. For the construction of highway, 3000 trees will slauhtered and residents of this area were unwillig and protesting the construction. At least 10 years later, now you can look for the effects of highway for that particular area.
            </p>
            <p>
               In this area mostly students was living and population of 100. yil district was more sparse than the other areas of Ankara. Students could go to university by walking and there was not any traffic jam. Now please compare that the current state of these areas with state of the 10 years ago. Are settlements increased? Is there any traffic jam? Do the trees still exist?
            </p>
            <p>
               Cordinates of this area: 39.896601, 32.8023 
            </p>
            <p>
               There is also a <span onclick="openVideo()" style="background: #555; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer">video</span> that recorded by the students of university, was about their ideas about the highway contruction.
