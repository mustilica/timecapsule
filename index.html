      <h3>Changing Face of My Habitat</h3>

      <p>This web page was created on October 1, 2013, as an assignment whose topic was to create a time capsule. The purpose of this time capsule is to save an image that captures the spirit of its date to be viewed in the future. I captured the image that you are viewing as a background of this site.</p>

      <p>The background image was taken from Google Maps which is a very popular map application developed and served by Google. It is a satellite image that shows Middle East Technical University and 100. Yil at Ankara, TURKEY. I. Melih Gokcek, mayor of Ankara, was building a highway between the border of the university, 100. Yil and Cigdem district. When this image was taken, highway construction had already begun but it was not finished. In this image, you cannot able to see the highway. In other words, route of highway and effects of it did not observable. For the construction of the highway, 3000 trees will be slaughtered and residents of this area were unwilling and protesting the construction. At least 10 years later, now you can look for the effects of the highway for that particular area.</p>

      <p>In this area mostly students were living and the population of 100. Yil district was more sparse than the other areas of Ankara. Students could go to university by walking and there was not any traffic jam. Now please compare that the current state of these areas with state of the 10 years ago. Are settlements increased? Is there any traffic jam? Do the trees still exist?</p>

      <p>Cordinates of this area: 39.896601, 32.8023</p>

      <p>There is also a <span onclick="openVideo()" style="background: #555; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; cursor: pointer">video</span> that recorded by the students of the university. It was about their ideas on the highway contruction.</p>
